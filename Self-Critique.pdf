For the modules, I decided to put them at the top for each HTML file as I believed that this would've been the easiest way to access each module, and created a placeholder file as a stand-in for the remaining six modules. In each file, I implemented the .select class for that file’s specific module. I used Georgia as the text font and Light cyan for the background color to make the website layout look unique. To distinguish the captions of the images from the text of each HTML file, I used the <em></em> command and created separate .figcaption classes to adjust the position of each caption. I think if I had more time, I would’ve formatted the captions to be centered under their respective images.
